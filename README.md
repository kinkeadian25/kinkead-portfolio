## Description

This website was built with React/JS and Tailwind! I love Tailwind, and anyone who wants a stylish and easy to manage website should definitely consider it! Tailwind has great documentation, and obviously React does as well. My goal with this site was just to show off my passion for making simple and effective apps. As well as to demonstrate what really makes me tick as an engineer. I also want everyone to know that I love C#!
